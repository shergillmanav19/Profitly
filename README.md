How to use:

I have made the app's login functionality that only an admin user can login and view my investments. Therefore, i would have to present the demo of the web app to you over zom/google hangouts.

You can create a user, i use firebase auth to handle it for me; however, you will be redirected to an unauthorized page. I chose this route because i didnt want to handle a user's sensitive information (their emails and passwords for investment exchanges) and just wanted a tracking app for myself.

App details:

Building an investment tracking app that will allow visualization of my investment portfolio in stocks and crypto.

The screenshots below show what the current app looks like
